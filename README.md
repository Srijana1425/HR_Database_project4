## üìä Tech ABC Corp HR Database Project 


## üöÄ Project Overview
This project involves designing and building a relational database for the Human Resources (HR) Department at Tech ABC Corp, a rapidly growing video game company. The objective is to transition from a spreadsheet system to a robust database management system to better handle employee information as the company scales in size.

## üìë Business requirement
Tech ABC Corp saw explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene with their new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they have gone from a small 10 person operation to 200 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR is having trouble keeping up with the growth, since they are still maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it has becoming increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands. 

## üìÇ Key Objectives
- **Understanding HR data requirements**
- **Normalizing and importing the HR dataset into a relational database set to the 3rd Normal Form (3NF)**
- **Creating entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) using Lucidchart**
   - Conceptual ERD
   - Logical ERD
   - Physical ERD
- **Validating and testing the final database design**

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 206 records with eleven columns, including
 - employee names
 - job titles
 - departments
 - managers' names
 - hire dates
 - start dates
 - end dates
 - work locations
 - salaries

## üé® Relational Database Design
Using the dataset provided and the requirements gathered in step one, we developed a relational database set to the 3rd Normal Form (3NF). We created three entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) using Lucidchart to represent our design process:
