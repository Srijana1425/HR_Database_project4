## HR Database

## Business requirement
Tech ABC Corp saw explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene 
with their new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they have gone from a small 
10 person operation to 200 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR is having 
trouble keeping up with the growth, since they are still maintaining employee 
information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it has becoming 
increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands. 

## Dataset
The `HR dataset` you will be working with is an Excel workbook which consists of 206 
records, with eleven columns. The data is in human readable format, and has not been 
normalized at all. The data lists the names of employees at Tech ABC Corp as well as 
information such as job title, department, manager's name, hire date, start date, end 
date, work location, and salary.
