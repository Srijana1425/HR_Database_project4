## Tech ABC Corp HR Database Project

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and building a relational database for the Human Resources (HR) Department at Tech ABC Corp, a rapidly growing video game company. The objective is to transition from a spreadsheet system to a robust database management system to better handle employee information as the company scales in size.

## Business requirement
Tech ABC Corp saw explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene with their new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they have gone from a small 10 person operation to 200 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR is having trouble keeping up with the growth, since they are still maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it has becoming increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands. 

## Key Objectives
1. Understanding HR data requirements
2. Normalizing and importing the HR dataset into a relational database set to the 3rd Normal Form (3NF)
3. Creating entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) using Lucidchart
   
    (i) Conceptual ERD
   
   (ii) Logical ERD
   
   (iii) Physical ERD
5. Validating and testing the final database design

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 206 records with eleven columns, including employee names, job titles, departments, managers' names, hire dates, start dates, end dates, work locations, and salaries. The data is currently in a human-readable format and requires normalization.
